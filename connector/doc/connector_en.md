## 2. Overview
The bionic robot quickly connects to the network and the target device (hereinafter referred to as fast connection) mainly has the following characteristics:
1. The bionic robot is in a WiFi environment;
    * WiFi can be a third-party routed WiFi;
    * WiFi can also be a hotspot placed outside the device where the APP is located.
2. The device where the App is located has been connected to the target WiFi;
3. The app initiates the bionic robot to connect to the target WiFi;
4. After the bionic robot successfully connects to the target WiFi, it connects to the device where the target APP is located;
5. Finally, quickly establish a connection with the target WiFi and device.

## 3. Design
### 3.1. Feature design

There are two main quick connection functions:
1. Distribution network function: realize the switch by long pressing the touch;
2. Automatic connection: realized through the system's own reconnection mechanism.
